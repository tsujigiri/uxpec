# uxpec

a testing tool for [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html)

## Usage

uxpec provides a tal-based DSL for testing your code. Namely, `describe`,
`context` and `it` functions that are used to *describe* what is being tested
and what *it* is supposed to behave like in a specific *context*. Further, it
provides assertions to be performed on the stack after your code under test has
run. So far there is one assertion, `;assert/true`, which checks whether the
value to be tested is a non-zero byte:

```
;describe JSR2 "my 20 "code 00
  ;context JSR2 "when 20 "this 20 "happens 00
    ;it JSR2 "does 20 "stuff 00
      ;my-code JSR2 ( leaves a result on the stack )
      ;assert/true JSR2 ( checks that the result is a non-zero byte )

;uxpec-exit JMP2` ( exit the test program with an appropriate exit code )
```

If the assertions are successful, the output on the terminal will look like
this:

```
my code
  when this happens
    does stuff ðŸ‘Œ
```

if they failed, it will look like this:

```
my code
  when this happens
    does stuff ðŸ”¥
```

and it will return with a non-zero exit code.

See `etc/demo.tal` for a complete example.

Run the demo with `make demo`.
